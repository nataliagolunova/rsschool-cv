Since 2021, I started to study frontend (html, css, javascript).
I study an online course on creating a landing site. I was learning HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery. [My website from the course.](https://nataliagolunova.github.io/Lending/index.html)

## Immediate goals: raise my level of programming in the frontend, switch to remote work and increase your income.

## Strengths:
I find fault with the little things, with the visual, with the comfortable work of the user and the developer, I can learn a new programming language in a short time, I can find information in Google.

## Programming languages and frameworks: delphi, sql, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery.


## Code example:
```
    //animation number 
    $('.count_statistic').each(function () {
       $(this).prop('Counter',0).animate({
        Counter: $(this).text()
        }, {
         duration: 4000,
         easing: 'linear',
         step: function (now) {
            $(this).text(Math.ceil(now));
         }
        });
    }); 
```
## English level: elementary. I study English in the "Duolingo" app and communicate in English in "Speaky".
